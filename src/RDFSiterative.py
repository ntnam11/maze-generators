# A disadvantage of the first approach is a large depth of recursion â€“ in the worst case,
# the routine may need to recur on every cell of the area being processed,
# which may exceed the maximum recursion stack depth in many environments.
# As a solution, the same backtracking method can be implemented with an explicit stack,
# which is usually allowed to grow much bigger with no harm.

# 1. Choose the initial cell, mark it as visited and push it to the stack
# 2. While the stack is not empty
#     1. Pop a cell from the stack and make it a current cell
#     2. If the current cell has any neighbours which have not been visited
#         1. Push the current cell to the stack
#         2. Choose one of the unvisited neighbours
#         3. Remove the wall between the current cell and the chosen cell
#         4. Mark the chosen cell as visited and push it to the stack
